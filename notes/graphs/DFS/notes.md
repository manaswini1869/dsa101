DFS algorithm is ideal in solving problems related to finding all of it's vertices, finding all the paths between two vertices, the algorithm can explore all the paths from the start vertex to all other vertices, finding all the paths between two vertices, the algorithm can explore all paths from the start vertex to all the other vertices

Used to:
- Traverse all vertices in a "graph"
- Traverse all paths between any two vertices in a "graph"
