# Binary Search

array of sorted elements
you have a sorted array arr and an element x, in O(log n) time and O(n) space:
- Find the index of x in arr
- Find where we can insert x in arr to maintain the sorted order


If the element you are searching for does not exist, then left will be at the
index where the element should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

Anytime the problem provides anything sorted
O(log n) is extremely fast and binary search is usually a huge optimization
