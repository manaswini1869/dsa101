# Binary Search

array of sorted elements
you have a sorted array arr and an element x, in O(log n) time and O(n) space:
- Find the index of x in arr
- Find where we can insert x in arr to maintain the sorted order


If the element you are searching for does not exist, then left will be at the
index where the element should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

Anytime the problem provides anything sorted
O(log n) is extremely fast and binary search is usually a huge optimization

question which involve finding - what is the max/min that something can be done
criteria:
1. you can quickly verify the task is possible for a given number x
2. If the task is possible for a number x, and you are looking for - a maximum (all numbers less than x), a minimum (all numbers greater than x)
3. If the task is not possible for a given number x - a maximum (all numbers greater than x), a minimum (all numbers less than x)

min/max - wants you to find the threshold where the task transitions from impossible to possible
