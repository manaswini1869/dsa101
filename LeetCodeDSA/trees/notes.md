dfs - recursion is easy
bfs - use double ended queue to implement the iterative approach


### Binary Search Trees

all values in its left side are less than the value in the node, all the values in its right subtree are
greater than the values in the node
values in the BST should be unique

With binary search tree searching, adding, removing can be done in O(log n) time on average

an inorder DFS (left, root, right) on a BST will handle the nodes in sorted order
