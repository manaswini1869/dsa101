# Greedy Algorithm

is any algorithm that makes the locally optimal decision at every step
optimal - depends on the problem constraints,
local - when the problem only considers the available options at the **current** step
a lot of problems involving heap can be considered greedy, greedy approaches will be choosing max/min at each step
sorting is closely related to the greedy algorithm
